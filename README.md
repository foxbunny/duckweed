Duckweed: JavaScript microframework for programming reactive interfaces using
Model-Action-View architecture

Duckweed is inspired by [Elm](http://elm-lang.org/) and [Simon Friis
Vindum's](https://github.com/paldepind) [Functional Frontend
Architecture](https://github.com/paldepind/functional-frontend-architecture).
Unlike its sources of inspiration, though, Duckweed's parimary goal is not to
promote or enforce functional programming paradigm. It's main goal is to provide
a simple API, and functions happen to be a good step in that direction.

Duckweed is written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org), and uses
[Snabbdom](https://github.com/snabbdom/snabbdom) under the hood.

# What's with the name?

[Duckweed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemnoideae) is a water plant with
simple no-frills features, and one of the fastest growing plants on Earth. It
has been argued that a single duckweed could create a mass of duckweeds the size
of the Earth in a single month. It is also an invaluable water purifier, and
being studied as a potential source of clean energy. What I'm trying to say is,
duckweed is pretty awesome.

# Benchmarks

It's... erm... fast enough. :)

# Under construction

Duckweed is still in very very early stages of development. A proof-of-concept
application can be found [on GitHub](https://github.com/foxbunny/selm). The
current Duckweed code base is an effort to factor out the reusable parts from
that repository, clean it up, write documentation...
